# T20-BBB-Simulator Project Brief

## Overview
The T20-BBB-Simulator is a sophisticated cricket simulation tool focused on T20 matches, designed to model and predict match outcomes using a Ball-by-Ball (BBB) approach. The project creates statistically accurate simulations of cricket matches for research and analysis purposes.

## Core Requirements
- Develop a comprehensive T20 cricket simulation model with ball-by-ball granularity
- Implement phase-specific player modeling based on historical statistics
- Create realistic team dynamics with role-based player selection
- Enable statistical analysis of simulation results including win probabilities
- Support multi-match simulations for robust statistical analysis
- Provide insights on key factors affecting match outcomes

## Goals
- Provide accurate modeling of T20 cricket matches with sophisticated statistical models
- Enable detailed analysis of player contributions based on phases (powerplay, middle, death)
- Support cricket research through quantitative simulation with advanced player and team modeling
- Create a tool that can predict match outcomes with meaningful confidence intervals
- Allow for complex analysis of batting/bowling matchups and team strategies

## Scope
- T20 format cricket matches simulation with detailed ball-by-ball engine
- Sophisticated player modeling with phase-specific performance characteristics
- Team composition analysis with objective role assignments
- Advanced match state tracking and key moment identification
- Multi-simulation capability for statistical confidence
- Analysis of simulation results with key factor identification
- Win probability modeling throughout match progression

## Success Criteria
